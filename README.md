# Community Event Calendar

This project will be a web-based community events calendar.  It is intended to be used by a group
of administrator/editors to accept submissions from local registered people or organizations of
events open to the pubic in a city to share with the community.

## Events and Series: What the calendar is built out of

### Events

This is what you are inviting the public to attend. Provide them with the date and time to show up,
describe what to expect, where to go, and what accessibility accomidations are available. Add
contact details, and links to a Facebook event or other information.

### Series

If some events are part of a larger program, you can group them into a series to let people know.

## How People Make the Calendar Work

### The Public

The public can browse, search and share events listed on the calendar. They can RSVP for events and
reach out to event organizers if the appropriate links and information is posted to the event.

### Contributors

These are people who have events to share with the public. They are granted accounts by
administrators so they can submit events for inclusion on the calendar. Those submissions are
reviewed by editors before they appear to the public. Trusted contributors can be granted direct
publishing permission to bypass this step.

### Editors

Editors approve events submitted by contributors.  They work with contributors to suggest changes
that would improve posted events.

### Administrators

Administrators manage the site's settings, and create and manage accounts for contributors and
editors.

### Organizations

Contributors may want to collaborate with other people where they work or volunteer. Grouping them
into an organization lets them work on submissions together. Organizations may have their own internal
editors to approve content before it is submitted ot the calendar. They may also have their own
administrators to add and manage people in the oranization.

## Reaching a Broader Audience: Translations and Accessibility

To help the calendar reach the most members of your community possible, the software is built to
support translating content into multiple languages, and will be built following the WAI-ARIA
accessibility standard. There are also sections of each event and location record for describing
accessibility provisions for attendees, to encourage event owners to take such matters into
consideration when they plan their events.
